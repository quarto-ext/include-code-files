# Include Code Files Extension For Quarto

Filter to include code from source files.

The filter is largely inspired by
[pandoc-include-code](https://github.com/owickstrom/pandoc-include-code).

## Installing

```bash
quarto add quarto-ext/include-code-files
```

This will install the extension under the `_extensions` subdirectory.  If you're using version control, you will want to check in this directory.  The `_extensions` directory needs to be in the same directory as your quarto code in order for quarto to be able to find the extension.

## Usage

The filter recognizes code blocks with the `include` attribute present. It swaps the content of the code block with contents from a file.

Here is how you add the filter to a page (it can also be added to a `_quarto.yml` project file with the same syntax):

````markdown
---
title: "My Document"
filters:
   - include-code-files
---

````

### Including Files

Once adding the filter to you page or project, the simplest way to use the filter is the `include` attribute

    ```{.python include="script.py"}
    ```

You can still use other attributes, and classes, to control the code blocks:

    ```{.python include="script.py" code-line-numbers="true"}
    ```

### Ranges

If you want to include a specific range of lines, use `start-line` and `end-line`:

    ```{.python include="script.py" start-line=35 end-line=80}
    ```

### Dedent

Using the `dedent` attribute, you can have whitespaces removed on each line, where possible (non-whitespace character will not be removed even if they occur
in the dedent area).

    ```{.python include="script.py" dedent=4}
    ```
