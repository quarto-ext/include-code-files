## `add-code-from`

You can include code from a file using `add-code-from` chunk option.

```{python}
#| add-code-from: external.py

# comment
```

**One very important detail to note that, you must put a random comment in code chunk so that the code chunk is not treated as empty, to make this filter work.**

## `start-line` & `end-line`

You can specify from which line to which line you want to include,


```{python}
#| add-code-from: external.py
#| start-line: 4
#| end-line: 5

# comment
```


## `dedent`

You can specify a line number for which whitespaces will be removed using the `dedent` option.
